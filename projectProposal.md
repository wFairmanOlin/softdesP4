# Data Visualization Project Proposal
### Authors: Sherrie Shen, William Fairman
### Date: 3/6/18

## Main Idea
Our project will involve creating a interactive map of restaurants in Boston. The data displayed will focus on sanitary inspections and potentially customer ratings gathered in Yelp and/or other social commentary sites.


## Minimum Value Product
We will deliver a map of Boston, split into regions (e.g. zip codes), that shows the average health ratings of restaurants in each region when clicked on by the user.
* An [example] of what our regional map will look like.

## Exploratory Topics
* Our stretch goal will allow users to view the ratio between failed and passed health inspections along with:
  * The severity of a restaurant's violations
  * The top 3 reasons for violations
  * The type of food a restaurant makes
* We are hoping to allow the user to filter the interactive map based on what data they want visualized

## Learning Goals
Sherrie
* Be able to use Pygame and Model View Controller to allow users to interact with the data visualization.
* Consolidate skills in writing different Class objects and methods.

William
* Be able to make a compelling interface that users enjoy interacting with and find helpful.
* Improve the structure and syntax of my code.

## Libraries and data
* Data source: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/food-establishment-inspections
* Python Libraries:
  * Pygame
  * Matplotlib

## Goals to have Accomplished by 3/9/17
* Have a map of Boston divided into regions rendered in Pygames
* Have a model that can be controlled by a mouse
* Have a UML diagram to visualize the necessary Objects and Classes for our MVP
* Have our data analyzed and ready for incorporation with Pygames

## Potential Risks
* Running into errors with Pygames and Matplotlib
* Failure to process data in time
* Not being able to create a map that can visualize different data sets
* Categorize restaurants by type of food
