## Project Overview
We wanted to visualize the City of Boston's data concerning the health ratings of local restaurants. This data, while providing crucial information, is only accessible in a csv file approximately half a million lines long. By implementing the Bokeh python library, we were able to display restaurants on Google maps in a format that made it easy to view the severity of their failed inspections and the percentage of failed inspections.

## Results
